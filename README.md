## üîç About
X_Entropy examines how climate change skepticism and misinformation spread on X by analyzing tweet data from the [Critical Climate Machine project](https://robillardstudio.github.io/ccm.html). The visualization combines entropy measurements with temporal analysis to reveal patterns in climate skepticism discourse.

The project's presentation adopts the scrollable format inspired by [.able journal](https://able.am/), creating an engaging and intuitive user experience that mirrors modern digital content consumption patterns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details
The visualization displays entropy values vertically over time, with horizontal bars representing entropy levels. Each bar is color-coded based on tweet categorization, combining:
- Tweet timestamp
- Topic classification
- Entropy measurement

The entropy calculation follows Claude Shannon's formula:
```
H(X) = -Œ£p(x)log2p(x)
```
where p(x) represents the probability of occurrence for each symbol in the text.

## üé® Design Elements
The project's visual identity incorporates X's rebranded design language while maintaining clarity in data presentation:

###Color Palette

Primary: #000000, #ffffff (X's official colors)
Data Categories: #4f7918, #a0421c, #198ba3, #7b108b, #aea02a

### Typography
The project uses Verdana, a sans-serif typeface chosen for its similarity to X's Chirp font family.
